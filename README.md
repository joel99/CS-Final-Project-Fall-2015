# CS-Final-Project-Fall-2015
Risk (Terminal) - Joel Ye and William Xiang
Note for Mr. Brown: to-do and devlog can be found in ProjectManagement folder. A bunch of features were ditched. Like AI. Unfortunately.
To launch the program, make sure you are in the same directory as Risk.java.
Type the following commands:
<br>$ javac Risk.java
<br>$ java Risk
<br><br>
The program should then run, and you will be guided from there. There will 
be a short rules rundown within the game itself, but for detailed rules, read
the Rules.txt file. 

Controls (Temporary)
- Type country name (Full, w/ capitalization) when prompted to select country. Type integers when prompted
- 'zoom in', 'zoom out' are recognized commands
- 'zoom <continent name>', 'zoom <country name>' may be recognized commands
- ijkl keys can be used to pan (type a letter and enter) the map.
- When in doubt, 'cancel' will save the day.

Risk - A Game of Domination
For 2-6 players
Try to conquer the world with your armies - each turn, one player gains 
reinforcements. From armies on countries, they can attack adjacent countries.
(See Rules.txt for attack mechanism). At the end of every turn, they can
fortify their countries with ONE troop transfer. If any countries were 
conquered that turn, the player will be given a card. (See Rules.txt for card
usage). The game is over once a player wons all 42 territories.
