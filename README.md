the Rules.txt file. 

Risk - A Game of Domination
For 2-6 players
Try to conquer the world with your armies - each turn, one player gains 
reinforcements. From armies on countries, they can attack adjacent countries.
(See Rules.txt for attack mechanism). At the end of every turn, they can
fortify their countries with ONE troop transfer. If any countries were 
conquered that turn, the player will be given a card. (See Rules.txt for card
usage). The game is over once a player wons all 42 territories.
