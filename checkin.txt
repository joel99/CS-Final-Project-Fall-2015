=== Obstacles Overcome ===
> Obtaining a printable world map
	> Solution: Take an image of a world map off the Internet, photoshop it to bolden lines,
	  and use an online Image>ASCII software to obtain an ASCII version of map
> Getting the map to fit in terminal
	> We realized that the ASCII map was too big for a regular terminal to fit
	> Solution: only show a portion of the map at once and pan/zoom the view to navigate map
> Generic commands vs Specific commands
	> We wanted generic commands, such as for zooming and panning, to work no matter what
	  stage the game was in, but we also wanted phase-based commands such as reinforcing
	  your country or attacking another country to only work in the certain phase, and we wanted
	  to do this all without writing obfuscated and repetitive code
	> Solution: We wrote a 'parse' method to filter out generic commands from more specific commands
> Getting the game to recognize which countries were adjacent to one another for battle purposes and 
what position the country was in so 'zoom <country>' would zoom to the right position
	> Solution: WE HARDCODEZ EVRYTING

=== Unresolved Issues ===
> Saving and loading game
	> Saving has always been on the top of our heads and we make accomodations for saving
	  as we code, but we haven't yet implemented the ability to save/load the game yet
> Fine-tuning user control and accessibility


=== Cool Stuff Learned ===
> Even driver level organization is essential for headache reduction
> ArrayLists are super useful actually, who needs traditional arrays :) - Joel. 

=== Mid-development Design Changes ===
> Moved country array from Risk.java to Game.java, because it made more logical sense (to clean up the
driver); in order to save the Country data, the country array had to be in Game.java.


=== Lessons Learned ===
> Our code in Risk.java is very
		              very
									  very
										  very
											  very
												shifted to the right, due to many necessary if/for/while clauses,
												so it made our code annoying to read in emacs, since we couldn't get
												horizontal scrolling to work. To remedy this, we're probably going to
												write a lot more helper functions to make the code easier to read
